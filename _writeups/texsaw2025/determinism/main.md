## Challenge description

Write a formal proof that the [polyadic pi-calculus [Milner, 1991]](https://era.ed.ac.uk/handle/1842/6050) is non-deterministic.

A semantics is non-deterministic if a state X can step to at least two distinct states Y1 and Y2.

Submissions deemed to be the output of a large language model will result in all further submissions for this challenge being ignored.

## solution

tien did this so im js gonna upload his pdf here
[download here](/api/writeup-assets/texsaw2025/determinism/determinism.pdf)

orz math orz tien
